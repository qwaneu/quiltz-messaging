# quiltz-messaging

python (email) messaging package 

## Purpose

At QWAN, we're building some applications in python. We collect useful stuff in
quiltz packages:

* [**quiltz-domain**](https://github.com/qwaneu/quiltz-domain) contains domain
  level modules like, entity id's, results, an email anonymizer, validators and
  parsers
* [**quiltz-testsupport**](https://github.com/qwaneu/quiltz-testsupport)
  contains test support modules, that supports mainly non unit tests, like
  integrating with smtp, probing asynchronous results and asserting log
  statements
* **quiltz-messaging** (this package) contains a messaging domain concept and an
  engine(s) to send the messages. Currently, only smtp sending is supported.

## installing 

```bash
pip install quitlz-messaging
```
